# How This Was Made

One person, one AI (Claude), 51 minutes start to finish.

## Timeline

**2:00 PM** — Uploaded Katie's 2-page PDF itinerary. Pasted Ella's text messages about what the group wants (budget, vibes, preferences). Asked Claude to help.

**2:03 PM** — Claude returned: budget breakdown of Katie's plan, analysis of what she got right/wrong, the cost case against Mykonos, and a 3-round group decision framework for 12 people.

**2:06 PM** — Asked Claude to write it up as a document. Planning Guide created.

**2:08 PM** — Kicked off two parallel deep research agents:
- Agent 1: Head-to-head comparison of 8 Greek islands (food, beaches, nightlife, villas, budget, Reddit/forum consensus)
- Agent 2: Villa and large-group accommodation research across 5 islands with real pricing

Both agents ran simultaneously while I did other work.

**2:13 PM** — Villa research completed (4.5 minutes). 5 islands researched, pricing tables built, specialist rental companies identified.

**2:23 PM** — Island comparison completed (6 minutes). 8 islands compared across 10 dimensions, 3 combo itineraries designed, sources cited.

**2:24 PM** — Both research rounds compiled into a single Island & Villa Research document.

**2:30 PM** — Asked about publishing as a website instead of sending PDFs. Decided on GitHub Pages.

**2:37 PM** — GitHub repo created, documents pushed, GitHub Pages enabled. Site live at sklar1000.github.io/greece-trip-2026.

**2:39 PM** — Added Katie's original itinerary as a clean reference doc + a README designed as an "AI Chat Kit" so Ella can upload everything to ChatGPT and work through decisions interactively with the group.

**2:41 PM** — Site rebuilt with all 4 pages live. Done.
