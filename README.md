# Greece Grad Trip 2026 — AI Chat Kit

## How to Use This

Upload ALL the documents in this repo to a ChatGPT (or Claude) conversation. Then you can ask questions, compare options, and work through decisions with the group in real time.

**Documents included:**
1. **Original Itinerary** (`original-itinerary.md`) — the starting proposed plan (Paros + Milos)
2. **Planning Guide** (`planning-guide.md`) — budget analysis, the Mykonos debate, and a group decision process
3. **Island & Villa Research** (`island-research.md`) — deep comparison of 8 Greek islands + villa options + recommended combos

## The Situation

- **Who**: 12 college seniors graduating in 2026
- **When**: June 1-10 (dates mostly locked)
- **Budget**: ~$2,000 per person beyond flights (covers accommodation, food, activities, inter-island transport). Budget is flexible.
- **Flying from**: Newark (EWR)

### What the Group Wants
- Big villa / house vibe where everyone stays together
- Great food — this is a priority
- Beautiful beaches that aren't terribly crowded
- Near restaurants and nightlife (not dead at night)
- Some people want Mykonos for the iconic party vibes; others are pushing back on cost

### What's NOT Wanted
- Rundown or overly touristy islands
- Terrible crowding
- Blowing the budget on accommodation and having nothing left for food/experiences

## What's Been Decided vs. What's Open

| Decision | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Dates (June 1-10) | Mostly locked |
| Flying from Newark | Decided |
| Greece as destination | Decided |
| Which islands | **OPEN** — original plan proposed Paros + Milos; research suggests Naxos + Paros may be stronger |
| Mykonos yes/no | **OPEN** — some want it, budget analysis says it's 2-5x more expensive |
| Accommodation style | Villa preferred, but hotel is fallback |
| Specific villa bookings | **OPEN** — need to search and book soon (June books fast) |
| Daily itinerary | **OPEN** — original plan has suggestions, nothing locked |
| How to split costs | **OPEN** |

## The Research Says

**Top recommendation: Naxos (5 nights) + Paros (4 nights)**

- **Naxos**: Best food value in the Cyclades, best villa availability for 12, huge uncrowded sandy beaches, decent nightlife in Chora. Cheapest quality island.
- **Paros**: Chic Naousa village, great restaurants and cocktail bars, solid beaches, enough nightlife. The "trendy" island without Mykonos prices.
- **25-minute ferry** between them. Zero wasted vacation time.
- **$2,000/person is comfortable** on both islands.

**Why not Mykonos**: A villa for 12 in June costs $750-1,500/person for accommodation alone (vs. $290-585 on Naxos/Paros). Food and drinks are 50-100% more expensive. Your $2,000 budget covers maybe 5-6 days uncomfortably on Mykonos vs. 9 days comfortably on Naxos + Paros.

**Alternative if nightlife is the top priority**: Naxos (5 nights) + Ios (4 nights). Ios has the best nightlife for 22-year-olds at a fraction of Mykonos prices. But villa options for 12 are weaker on Ios.

## Questions to Work Through with the Group

Use these as conversation starters. The AI has all the research to help answer follow-ups.

### 1. Islands
- Are we doing 2 islands or 3?
- Is Mykonos still on the table? (Show them the cost comparison)
- Does anyone strongly want Milos for the beaches? (Sarakiniko, Kleftiko are incredible but nightlife is dead and villa options are weak)

### 2. Accommodation
- One big villa or two smaller ones next to each other?
- Is the "villa house vibe" a must-have or a nice-to-have?
- Who's searching for villas? (Need to start NOW — June books fast)

### 3. Budget
- What's everyone's actual hard ceiling? ("Flexible" doesn't help when booking)
- Are we splitting everything evenly or itemizing?
- Who's collecting money and booking?

### 4. Vibes
- What's more important: beaches or nightlife?
- Does anyone want cultural/historic stuff (ruins, mountain villages, cooking class)?
- Are there any dealbreakers? (e.g., "I refuse to share a room with more than one person")

## Example Prompts for the Chat

Once you've uploaded the docs, try asking things like:

- "Compare Mykonos vs Paros for our group — show me the real cost difference"
- "What are the best villas on Naxos for 12 people in June?"
- "If we do Naxos + Paros, what does a day-by-day itinerary look like?"
- "How do we get from Athens to Naxos? What are the ferry options?"
- "What restaurants should we book in advance in Naousa?"
- "If 4 people really want Mykonos, could we do a day trip from Paros?"
- "Build us a budget spreadsheet — what will this trip actually cost per person?"
- "What's the argument against the original plan?"
- "We decided on Naxos + Paros. Now help us find villas."
