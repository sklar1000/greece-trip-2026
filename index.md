# Greece Grad Trip 2026

12 travelers, June 1-10. Two docs to help the group decide.

## Documents

### [Planning Guide](planning-guide)
Katie's itinerary analysis, budget breakdown, the Mykonos question, and a 3-round process for 12 people to agree on a trip without killing each other.

### [Island & Villa Research](island-research)
Head-to-head comparison of 8 Greek islands (Paros, Milos, Naxos, Mykonos, Ios, Santorini, Crete, Koufonisia), villa options for 12, and recommended island combos ranked.

---

**TL;DR**: Naxos (5 nights) + Paros (4 nights) is the top pick. Best food, best villa availability for 12, great beaches, 25-min ferry between them, and $2,000/person is comfortable on both.
