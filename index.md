## Use These Docs with AI

Want to work through decisions interactively? Download all the markdown files from [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/sklar1000/greece-trip-2026) and upload them to a ChatGPT or Claude conversation. Then ask questions like:

- "Compare Mykonos vs Paros — show me the real cost difference for 12 people"
- "If we do Naxos + Paros, what does a day-by-day look like?"
- "What are the best villas on Naxos for 12 in June?"
- "We decided on islands — now help us build a budget spreadsheet"

The [README](https://github.com/sklar1000/greece-trip-2026/blob/main/README.md) has the full AI chat kit with situation context and suggested prompts.

**TL;DR**: Naxos (5 nights) + Paros (4 nights) is the top recommendation. Best food, best villa availability for 12, great beaches, 25-min ferry between them, and $2,000/person is comfortable on both.
