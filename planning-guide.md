# Greece Grad Trip 2026 — Planning Guide

[Back to home](./) | [Island & Villa Research](island-research)

## Original Proposed Itinerary — Budget Breakdown

**Route**: Newark → Athens → Paros (4 nights) → Milos (3 nights) → Athens (1 night) → Newark

| Item | Cost per person |
|------|------|
| Paros accommodation (Harmony Villa, 4 nights) | $428 |
| Milos accommodation (Aeolis Hotel, 3 nights) | $85 |
| Athens → Paros flight | $162 |
| Paros → Milos ferry | $70 |
| Milos → Athens flight | $155 |
| Athens hotel (1 night, TBD) | ~$50-80 |
| **Transport + lodging subtotal** | **~$950-980** |
| **Remaining for food/activities (of $2,000)** | **~$1,020-1,050** |

That's roughly $130/day for food and activities in the Greek islands in June — comfortable but not lavish.

## What the Original Plan Got Right

- **Paros and Milos are genuinely strong picks** — not the obvious tourist traps, legitimately great food scenes, beautiful beaches, and way more authentic than Mykonos or Santorini.
- **Naousa is the right base on Paros** — walkable to beaches, restaurants, and nightlife. It's where you want to be.
- **The routing works** — Athens → Paros → Milos → Athens is a natural loop with short hops (no backtracking).
- **June timing is ideal** — peak enough for everything to be open, not yet August-crowded.

## What Could Be Better

- **Milos accommodation** is a hotel, not a villa. If the group wants the "big villa house" vibe, this needs to be swapped for a VRBO/Airbnb.
- **The itinerary doesn't address the Mykonos question** — it just skips it. The group needs to see *why* Paros/Milos wins before they'll let go of Mykonos.
- **No budget buffer** for boat rentals, nicer dinners, or spontaneous activities.

## The Mykonos Question

Some people want Mykonos for the iconic party vibes. Here's the honest comparison:

| | Mykonos | Paros |
|---|---------|-------|
| **Nightlife** | World-class clubs, expensive | Great bars + beach clubs, way cheaper |
| **Beaches** | Good but crowded in June | Excellent, less crowded, more variety |
| **Food** | Overpriced tourist spots dominate | Genuinely great local food scene |
| **Villa for 12** | $$$$ (expect 2-3x Paros prices) | Reasonable — $400-500/person for 4 nights |
| **Vibe** | Influencer/party, can feel performative | Relaxed, authentic, still fun at night |
| **For your budget** | Would eat most of the $2,000 on lodging alone | Leaves real money for food and experiences |

**The case against Mykonos at your budget**: A villa for 12 in Mykonos in June would likely cost $800-1,200/person for 4 nights. That's your entire non-flight budget on just one island's accommodation. You'd be staying somewhere nice but eating cheap and skipping activities.

**The case for Paros**: You get the beach + nightlife + food trifecta at roughly half the cost, which means you actually *enjoy* the trip instead of just surviving it financially.

## How 12 People Agree on a Trip (Without Killing Each Other)

### Round 1: Non-Negotiables Survey (5 minutes, do this first)

Send a quick Google Form to all 12 people with these questions:

1. **What's your actual hard budget ceiling?** (not "flexible" — the real max beyond flights)
2. **Are the dates locked?** June 1-10 or is there flex?
3. **Rank your top 3 priorities:**
   - Great beaches
   - Nightlife / party scene
   - Food scene / eating well
   - Cultural / historic sites
   - Villa / house vibe (living together)
   - Instagram-worthy spots
   - Keeping costs low
4. **Any dealbreakers?** (Things you absolutely won't do)

This kills 80% of the arguments. If 8 of 12 people rank food + beaches over nightlife, Mykonos dies on data — not on one person's opinion.

### Round 2: Island Shortlist Vote (after survey results)

Take the survey results and narrow to 2-3 island combinations that fit what the group actually wants. Present a side-by-side comparison with:
- Vibe + what it's known for
- Cost for the group
- Food and beach quality
- Nightlife rating
- Villa availability for 12

Group votes on their preferred combo using **ranked choice** (everyone ranks 1st, 2nd, 3rd). This prevents the loudest person from winning.

### Round 3: Book It (one person executes)

- The winning combo gets **one planner** who books everything. No design-by-committee on restaurants and daily schedules.
- The planner proposes a day-by-day outline. Group gets **one round** of swap requests. Then it's locked.
- Everyone Venmos their share within 48 hours of booking.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Send the Round 1 survey tonight — takes 5 minutes to make in Google Forms
2. While waiting for responses, research villa options on the top island candidates for 12 people in June
3. Once survey results are in, build the Round 2 comparison and vote
4. Target: have the trip booked within 2 weeks (flights will only get more expensive)
