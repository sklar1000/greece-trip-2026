# Greece Grad Trip 2026 — Island & Villa Research

[Back to home](./) | [Planning Guide](planning-guide)

**For**: 12 college seniors, June 1-10, ~$2,000/person beyond flights
**Priorities**: Great food, beautiful beaches, big villa house vibe, some nightlife, not overcrowded

---

## The Bottom Line (Read This First)

**Best combo for your group: Naxos (4-5 nights) + Paros (4-5 nights)**

- Naxos has the best food, best villa availability for 12, and biggest uncrowded beaches
- Paros has the chic restaurants, cocktail bars, and Instagram-worthy scenery
- 25-minute ferry between them — you lose zero vacation time to transit
- $2,000/person is comfortable on both islands
- If someone really wants Mykonos, it's a day-trip ferry from either island

The original instinct on Paros is sound. Pairing it with Naxos covers the weaknesses (villa availability, food value, beach variety) while keeping everything the first plan liked.

## Island Deep Dives

### 1. PAROS (Original Pick #1) — The All-Rounder

**Vibe**: The "it" island right now — crowned world's best island by Travel + Leisure. Trendy without being obnoxious. Naousa (north) is the social hub: waterfront bars, excellent restaurants, boutique shopping, and enough nightlife to keep things interesting. Parikia (port town) has more casual nightlife and a backpacker edge.

**Food**: Excellent and diverse. Naousa has upscale seafood (Yemeni, Soso), casual waterfront tavernas, and Instagram-friendly brunch spots. Budget 30-50 EUR for a nice dinner. Not cheap, but the quality justifies it. Fresh juices and baked goods at Ragoussis. Sunset dinner at Siparos.

**Beaches**: Strong variety. Kolymbithres (unique granite rock formations), Santa Maria (organized, younger crowd, water sports), Golden Beach (windsurfing), Logaras (quieter). June crowds: moderate — busy at popular spots midday, but nothing like August. Manageable.

**Nightlife**: Not Mykonos-level, but solid for a fun night out. Barbarossa in Naousa (dine then dance), cocktail bars along the waterfront. Parikia has more casual late-night bars. You won't be bored, but the dedicated party crowd might want more.

**Villa for 12**: Doable but book early. Naousa-area villas for 12 with private pool run $400-700/night mid-range ($33-58/person/night). Some options:
- **Villa Margo I** (Oliver's Travels) — 6 bedrooms, sleeps 12, pool, sea views, 2 min from beach
- **Villa Paria** (Oliver's Travels) — 6 en-suite bedrooms, main house + guest house, infinity pool
- Fallback: 3 adjacent apartments in Naousa ($40/person/night), walkable to everything

**Budget per person (5 nights)**: $165-290 accommodation + food/activities = fits within $2,000 total

**Downsides**: Getting more expensive every year. Naousa is trending "influencer chic." Nightlife won't fully satisfy the Mykonos-wanting contingent. Wind can be intense on certain beaches.

**Reddit consensus**: "Paros is the best all-around Cycladic island right now." Critics note it's starting to feel curated and cocktails are overpriced. Most posters still rate it highly.

---

### 2. NAXOS — Best Value, Best Food, Best Villa Options

**Vibe**: The largest Cycladic island and the one that feels most like "real Greece." Fertile valleys, mountain villages, ancient ruins (Temple of Apollo), and long sandy beaches. Less polished than Paros, more laid-back, genuinely local. Naxos Town (Chora) has a Venetian castle on top and a charming old town.

**Food**: THE BEST FOOD VALUE ON THIS LIST. Naxos grows its own potatoes (famous throughout Greece), makes its own cheeses, olives, honey, and lamb. Mountain village of Filoti has the best traditional Greek food in the Cyclades. Dinner at a good taverna: 15-25 EUR. A group cooking class at Basiliko in Potamia (pick vegetables, cook, dance) is the perfect group activity.

**Beaches**: Excellent and uncrowded. The west coast is a continuous stretch of golden sand: Agios Prokopios (organized, close to town), Agia Anna (quieter), Plaka (massive, endless, never feels crowded even in August), Mikri Vigla (windsurfing). These are sandy beaches — unusual for Greece. June crowds: genuinely light.

**Nightlife**: Decent but not electric. Naxos Town waterfront has bars and clubs: Ocean Club (open-air, house/Latin), Like Home (cocktails, dancefloor, parties til dawn), Dome Lounge Bar (young crowd, live music). Cheaper than anywhere else. Fun nights out, but not a "destination" nightlife scene.

**Villa for 12**: BEST OPTIONS ON THIS LIST. Naxos is larger with more development = more large villas available.
- **Villa Oskelos Estate** (Oliver's Travels) — 5 en-suite bedrooms, sleeps 12, private pool, near Kastraki beach
- **Island White Villas** (Plaka Beach) — 5 bed/5 bath sleeping 12, on the beach
- **Villa Gold & White** — up to 12 guests, hydromassage pool, sea views
- Price range: $350-600/night total ($29-50/person/night) — significantly cheaper than Paros

**Best areas to stay**:
- **Agios Prokopios** — beautiful protected beach, beach clubs, great dining, walkable, younger crowd, easy bus to Chora for nightlife. Top pick for this group.
- **Naxos Town (Chora)** — best nightlife, walkable from Agios Georgios beach
- **Plaka Beach** — stunning, more laid-back, some villa complexes

**Budget per person (4-5 nights)**: $120-250 accommodation + food/activities = easily fits $2,000

**Downsides**: Less "instagrammable" than Paros. The island is big — you need a car to see it properly. Less "chic" shopping/cocktail energy.

**Reddit consensus**: "Naxos is the best-kept secret in the Cyclades." "Best food, best value, best beaches for the price." "The island for people who actually like Greece, not just the Instagram version."

---

### 3. MILOS (Original Pick #2) — Stunning Beaches, Tricky for Groups

**Vibe**: The beach island. Volcanic landscape gives it 70+ beaches with otherworldly colors and rock formations. More rugged and adventurous than Paros — "rent an ATV and find a hidden cove" energy. Draws photographers and nature lovers more than partiers.

**Food**: Very good, especially seafood. Enalion in Pollonia is the standout. Prices slightly lower than Paros. Budget 20-35 EUR for dinner. Excellent but narrower selection — fewer restaurants total.

**Beaches**: THE BEST BEACHES IN GREECE, ARGUABLY. Sarakiniko (white lunar moonscape — the iconic photo), Kleftiko (sea caves, boat access only), Firiplaka (volcanic cliffs), Tsigrado (tiny cove, ladder access). Many require a car/ATV to reach.

**Nightlife**: Minimal. Adamas has bars for post-dinner drinks. No club scene. "Milos is not a party island."

**Villa for 12**: HARDER. Most villas cap at 6-8 guests. You'd likely need two adjacent properties or a villa complex.
- **Serenity House** — two traditional villas on shared land with pool
- **Thiopetra Villas** — 2 independent villas, shared pool and gym
- Hotel alternative: Aeolis Hotel in Adamas ($85/person for the stay — per original plan)
- Price range: two villas combined at $500-900/night ($42-75/person/night)

**The car problem**: You NEED a car or ATV on Milos. For 12 people, that's 3-4 rentals at $30-40/day each.

**Budget per person (3 nights)**: $125-225 accommodation + car rental + food = manageable but tighter

**Downsides**: Nightlife is a non-starter. Vehicle logistics for 12. Fewer restaurants = you repeat spots. More isolated in the ferry network. Accommodation for 12 together is genuinely difficult.

**Reddit consensus**: "Milos has the best beaches in Greece, full stop." "Don't go for nightlife — go for nature." Consistently recommended as a 2-3 night stop, less as a full-week base.

### 4. MYKONOS — The Expensive Party Island

**Vibe**: The most famous Greek island. Luxury party destination with world-class beach clubs, designer shopping, celebrity nightlife. Glamorous, expensive, polarizing. Old town is genuinely beautiful (windmills, Little Venice), but the island has been overrun by tourism and influencer culture.

**Food**: High-end and expensive. Great restaurants exist, but a taverna dinner that's 25 EUR on Naxos is 45-60 EUR here. Budget 80-120 EUR/person/day for food and drinks.

**Beaches**: Good but crowded and monetized. Famous beaches dominated by beach clubs charging 30-80 EUR for sunbeds. The free-beach experience is limited.

**Nightlife**: THE REASON PEOPLE COME. Cavo Paradiso, Scorpios, SantAnna. World-class DJs, all-night parties. Legitimately one of the best nightlife destinations in Europe. But: cover charges 20-50 EUR, cocktails 15-25 EUR, bottle service hundreds+.

**Villa for 12**: Available but budget-breaking.

| | Naxos | Paros | Mykonos |
|---|---|---|---|
| Villa (12 pax, pool, 9 nights) | $3,500-5,500 | $4,500-7,000 | $9,000-18,000 |
| Per person accommodation | $290-460 | $375-585 | $750-1,500 |
| Dinner for 12 | $200-300 | $250-350 | $400-600 |
| Beach club day | Free-$20/pp | Free-$30/pp | $50-100/pp |

**The hard truth**: Even the cheapest viable villa for 12 ($800+/night) plus Mykonos food/drink markup means $2,000/person covers maybe 5-6 days uncomfortably. Your budget works on Paros/Naxos for 9 days with money to spare.

**Reddit consensus**: Deeply polarized. "Incredible if you have the budget." "Overpriced and overrated." Most common advice for young groups: **do 2 nights max, pair with a cheaper island.** Early June is the best time if you do go (20-30% cheaper than peak).

---

### 5. IOS — The Party-Budget Dark Horse

**Vibe**: Greece's party island for young travelers. Chora (the hilltop village) comes alive after midnight with cheap shots, open-air bars, and a "5 shots for 5 EUR" energy. But the beaches are genuinely world-class and the food is underrated. Has been evolving beyond its backpacker reputation.

**Food**: Underrated and cheap. Genuinely good Greek food at generous prices. Dinner: 12-22 EUR. Drinks: absurdly cheap by island standards. Best quality-price ratio for casual dining.

**Beaches**: Excellent. Mylopotas (long, sandy, all facilities, younger crowd), Maganari (awarded "best beaches in the world" multiple times). Quality is genuinely high.

**Nightlife**: THE BEST ON THIS LIST FOR 22-YEAR-OLDS. Far Out Beach Club (massive open-air venue, pool parties starting 4pm). Chora after midnight until sunrise. Unpretentious, affordable, rowdy. Not "cool" in the Mykonos sense — fun in the "graduation trip" sense.

**Villa for 12**: Challenging. Ios caters more to hostels and apartments. You'd need 2-3 adjacent properties.
- **Villa Mylo** — 5 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, two pools. Best single option found.
- More realistic: book two adjacent villas or apartment blocks
- Price range: $300-600/night total ($25-50/person/night) — cheapest island on the list

**Budget per person (4 nights)**: $100-200 accommodation + food/activities = very affordable

**Downsides**: Limited villa options for the "big house" vibe. Can feel "spring break-ish." Less architecturally pretty than Paros. Narrower food variety.

**Reddit consensus**: "Best party island in Greece, no contest." "Way cheaper than Mykonos for the same energy." "The beaches shocked me." "Perfect for college-age groups."

---

### 6. SANTORINI — Skip It for This Trip

**Why it doesn't work**: Santorini is for couples and cruise ship tourists, not 12 college seniors looking for a villa. The beaches are the weakest on this list (volcanic, narrow, crowded). Nightlife is dead. Accommodation for 12 together is nearly impossible — the island is designed for boutique 2-person cave hotels. A dinner for 12 at a caldera-view restaurant runs $600-800.

**Reddit consensus**: Near-universal: "Santorini is for couples, not groups." "Skip it entirely if beaches and nightlife matter." Worth a day trip from Ios if you want the sunset photo, but don't base here.

## Recommended Island Combos (Ranked)

### COMBO 1: Naxos (5 nights) + Paros (4 nights) — THE TOP PICK

| Day | Location | Highlights |
|-----|----------|------------|
| Jun 1 | Fly Newark → Athens | Red-eye arrives Jun 2 morning |
| Jun 2-6 | Naxos | Big villa with pool, cooking class at Basiliko, Plaka beach days, mountain village visit, Ocean Club nights |
| Jun 6 | Ferry to Paros | 25 min morning ferry |
| Jun 6-9 | Paros (Naousa) | Kolymbithres/Santa Maria beaches, wine bars, Barbarossa, last-night group dinner |
| Jun 9 | Fly to Athens | Evening in Plaka neighborhood |
| Jun 10 | Fly Athens → Newark | Morning flight |

**Why it wins**: Naxos solves the villa problem (large properties, affordable). Paros satisfies the "aspirational island" desire driving Mykonos interest. Food across both is the best in the Cyclades. 25-min ferry = zero wasted time. Nightlife is sufficient without being the identity.

**Budget estimate**: ~$1,800-2,100/person total beyond flights. Comfortable, not stretched.

---

### COMBO 2: Naxos (5 nights) + Ios (4 nights) — THE PARTY-FRIENDLY PICK

Same Naxos start (villa, food, beaches), then ferry to Ios for nightlife. If the group survey shows nightlife as a top priority, this is the move.

**Budget estimate**: ~$1,500-1,800/person. Cheapest combo. Downside: Ios villa for 12 is harder — may need 2 properties.

---

### COMBO 3: Paros (4 nights) + Milos (3 nights) — THE ORIGINAL PLAN

This is the original proposal. It works, but Milos accommodation for 12 is the weak link (hotel, not villa) and Milos nightlife is dead. The beaches on Milos are jaw-dropping though — Sarakiniko and Kleftiko are once-in-a-lifetime.

**Budget estimate**: ~$1,800-2,200/person. The Milos leg is tighter due to car rentals and fewer options.

## Villa Booking — What You Need to Know

### One Big Villa vs. Two Smaller Ones

| Factor | One Big Villa | Two Smaller Villas |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Group bonding | Everyone together, communal vibe | Split into sub-groups |
| Cost | Usually cheaper (one pool, one cleaning fee) | Two of everything |
| Availability | Harder to find for 12 | Much easier |
| Privacy | Early sleepers vs. night owls clash | Natural escape valve |

**Recommendation**: Try for one big villa first (that's the vibe you want). Fall back to two adjacent/same-complex villas if not available.

### Specialist Villa Rental Companies (Cyclades)

| Company | Best For | Price Tier |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Oliver's Travels | Finding specific 12-person villas, concierge | Upper-mid to luxury |
| Villanovo | Wide range, 114 Cyclades villas | EUR 262-14,000/night |
| Group Accommodation | Purpose-built for large groups | Budget to mid |
| SimplyOwners | Direct with owners, no booking fees | Budget to mid |
| Airbnb / VRBO | Most mid-range options | Mid-range |

### Booking Tips

- **Book NOW** — you're at the 3.5-month mark and June books fast, especially for 12-person properties
- Early June (Jun 1-10) is the sweet spot: prices 20-30% below late June peak
- Many properties list 10-person max but will accommodate 12 — message hosts directly
- Search for the island name (not just the town) — villas 5-10 min drive away are 30-40% cheaper
- **Collect money from the group BEFORE booking.** Non-negotiable. The #1 group trip failure is someone dropping out after the non-refundable deadline.

### Cancellation Policies

- **Airbnb**: Look for "Flexible" or "Moderate." Many Greek villas use "Strict" (50% refund up to 1 week before).
- **VRBO**: Many require 50% deposit at booking, balance 30-60 days before. After the balance deadline = lose everything.
- **Specialist agencies** (Oliver's Travels): Usually more protective — free cancellation 8+ weeks before.

## What to Do Next

1. **Send the Round 1 survey to the group** (see Planning Guide doc) — get actual priorities before picking islands
2. **Start searching villas NOW** on Airbnb, VRBO, and Oliver's Travels for Naxos and Paros, June 1-10, 12+ guests with pool
3. **Email Oliver's Travels** with your dates, group size, and budget ($500-700/night max) — they have 12-person properties catalogued
4. **Have everyone Venmo their share** before anyone books anything
5. **Target**: trip booked within 2 weeks — flights and villas only get more expensive from here
